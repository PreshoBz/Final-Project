# 🧮 Simple Math Expression Scanner

This project reads a math expression like `5 + (3 * -2)` and breaks it into smaller parts called **tokens**. These tokens can be numbers, symbols like `+` or `-`, or parentheses.

## 📄 Files in the Project

- `main.cpp` – The main program. It asks for input and shows the tokens.
- `scanner.h` – This file lists the types of tokens and the scanner function.
- `scanner.cpp` – This file does the work of finding tokens in the input.

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

To run the application you must use Visual Studio Code.  The user must compile using the command, "g++ main.cpp scanner.cpp -o scanner_app", 
in the terminal of Visual Studio Code. When the compilation has been successful the user can run it in the terminal using the command "./scanner_app" in the terminal.
